              The COVID-19 pandemic may have brought many changes to how you
              live your life, and with it, at times, uncertainty, altered daily
              routines, financial pressures and social isolation. You may worry
              about getting sick, how long the pandemic will last, whether your
              job will be affected and what the future will bring. Information
              overload, rumors and misinformation can make your life feel out of
              control and make it unclear what to do. During the COVID-19
              pandemic, you may experience stress, anxiety, fear, sadness and
              loneliness. And mental health disorders, including anxiety and
              depression, can worsen. Surveys show a major increase in the
              number of U.S. adults who report symptoms of stress, anxiety,
              depression and insomnia during the pandemic, compared with surveys
              before the pandemic. Some people have increased their use of
              alcohol or drugs, thinking that can help them cope with their
              fears about the pandemic. In reality, using these substances can
              worsen anxiety and depression. People with substance use
              disorders, notably those addicted to tobacco or opioids, are
              likely to have worse outcomes if they get COVID-19. That's because
              these addictions can harm lung function and weaken the immune
              system, causing chronic conditions such as heart disease and lung
              disease, which increase the risk of serious complications from
              COVID-19. For all of these reasons, it's important to learn
              self-care strategies and get the care you need to help you cope.

              The psychological impact of quarantine related to COVID-19
              infection
            </h1>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              The modern world in which all individuals are able to rapidly
              travel and communicate has been rarely forced to the current
              social isolation and restrictions which are linked to feelings of
              frustration and incertainty. This unprecedented situation related
              to COVID-19 outbreak is clearly demonstrating that individuals are
              largely and emotionally unpreparated to the detrimental effects of
              biological disasters that are directly showing how everyone may be
              frail and helpless. Social distancing and important lockdown
              restrictions have been carried out first in China and later in
              most European countries where Italy and Spain experienced a tragic
              growth of the number of positive cases.{" "}

              Although government regulations are necessary to maintain social
              balance and guarantee the safety of all individuals, a direct
              strategy aimed to manage the psychosocial issues related to
              COVID-19 crisis and its consequences in the community is currently
              lacking. The psychological outcomes for subjects who have been
              quarantined compared with those who did not, have been examined by
              both cross-sectional10–14 and longitudinal studies.15,16Table 1
              summarized the most relevant information about the psychological
              impact of lockdown restrictions and quarantine included in these
              studies.
            </p>
            <h1>Most relevant psychological reactions to COVID-19 infection</h1>
            <h2>Pervasive anxiety</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              Social isolation related to restrictions and lockdown measures are
              linked to feelings of uncertainty for the future, fear of new and
              unknown infective agents resulting in abnormally increased
              anxiety.25 Anxiety may be directly related to sensorial
              deprivation and pervasive loneliness, in this case first insomnia
              but later depression and post-traumatic stress occurred. In
              addition, anxiety is closely associated with fatigue and reduced
              performance in healthcare workers while boredom and loneliness are
              directly related to anger, frustration and sufferings linked to
              quarantine restrictions.26 Furthermore, additional tragic effects
              associated with pervasive anxiety in a pandemic period may include
              the perceived lower social support, separation from loved ones,
              loss of freedom, uncertainty and boredom.30
            </p>
            <h2>Frustration and boredom</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              {" "}
              Distress, boredom, social isolation and frustration are directly
              related to confinement, abnormally reduced social/physical contact
              with others, and loss of usual habits.15,19,20,23,28,29 As
              reported by Jeong et al.,27 frustration and pervasive loneliness
              seem to derive by the inhibition from daily activities,
              interruption of social necessities, not taking part in social
              networking activities. Unfortunately, in this context hopelessness
              together with other individual characteristics such as the
              experience of childhood maltreatment as well as extreme sensory
              processing patterns may significantly and independently predict
              suicidal behavior31,32 but even the unbearable anger related to
              the imposition of quarantine may lead to negative outcomes.
            </p>
            <h2>Disabling loneliness</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              The final effect of social isolation is pervasive loneliness and
              boredom, which have potential dramatic effects on both physical
              and mental individual well-being. Pervasive loneliness may be
              significantly associated with increased depression and suicidal
              behavior.23 Unfortunately, the isolation is progressively enhanced
              by anxiety, panic or collective hysteria. Cognitive functions and
              decision making are firstly impaired by hyperarousal and anxiety
              and later by disabling feelings of loneliness. In addition, social
              isolation and loneliness are also associated with alcohol and drug
              abuse.14 Both frustration and pervasive loneliness seem to derive
              by the inhibition from daily activities, interruption of social
              necessities, inability to take part in social networking
              activities enhancing the risk of hopelessness and suicidal
              behavior in this specific context.33 Overall, it is well known
              that long periods of social isolation or quarantine for specific
              illnesses may have detrimental effects on mental well-being.34
            </p>
            <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
            <h2>Alexithymia</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              The risk of related quarantine distress may be also due to the
              presence of alexithymic traits which may reduce psychological
              resilience in some subgroups of individuals.35–37 Alexithymia may
              be literally defined as ‘no words for mood’ and was initially
              identified to describe cognitive and affective features in
              patients with psychosomatic disorders. Alexithymic individuals may
              show significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and
              psychological distress than non-alexithymics. In summary, the
              alexithymia construct applied to major depressive disorder (MDD)
              subjects showed a significant correlation between alexithymia
              traits, MDD severity and increased risk of suicidal behavior.
            </p>
            <h2>Inadequate supplies</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead " id="protect">
              Importantly, feelings of frustration and incertainty tend to occur
              even in relation with inadequate basic supplies (e.g. food, water,
              clothes etc.) during the quarantine period which is a major source
              of worries, and anxiety/anger even after 4–6 months from
              quarantine.27 There are studies demonstrating that supplies
              provided by public health authorities in order to address the
              outbreak may be inappropriate or their release may be carried out
              too late to successfully address the needs. For instance,
              thermometers or masks may be received too late while water and
              food were only inconsistently distributed.23 DiGiovanni et al.20
              reported that during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, the
              government was unable to meet needs for groceries and other
              routine supplies needed for daily living.
            </p>
            <h1 id="">Protective factors</h1>
            <h2>Resilience</h2>
            <p id="social" class="text-justify lead">
              Psychological resilience may be generally defined as the ability
              to support or retrieve psychological well-being during or after
              addressing stressful disabling conditions. Although the
              interconnectedness increased dramatically over the past decades,
              similarly the vulnerability of billions of individuals across the
              world to existing or novel pathogens tragically increased without
              a corresponding enhancement in coping abilities.24 Historically,
              different indices have been adopted to measure resilience and
              individual ability to react to social, economic and political
              threats, including public health emergencies. Unfortunately, being
              less resilient to social threats, such as pandemics, may enhance
              the risk of developing psychiatric conditions.25 Notably, a
              general message of hope and social protection given by healthcare
              regulatory authorities and scientists not only about the risk of
              being infected but even about the existence of containment
              measurements that may be implemented in the hospitals and in the
              community as a whole may enhance resilience and individual
              abilities to successfully react to social threats.30
            </p>
            <h1>Social support</h1>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              A higher and significant perception of social support is
              associated with a reduced likelihood to develop psychological
              distress and psychiatric conditions. Conversely, according to a
              recent online survey conducted in South Korea,30 most (72.0%) of
              the respondents reported they could get someone else’s support if
              they were isolated due to COVID-19, and 28.0% clearly reported
              they would not have social support. Adequate social support for
              the general population with regard to specific at risk populations
              (e.g. infected patients, quarantined individuals and medical
              professionals) should be provided by offering targeted, tailored
              messages according to the most reliable scientific evidence.
              Relevantly, a variety of mental health supporting strategies are
              required in pandemic areas in order to facilitate lifestyle
              changes and re-adaptation activities required after the occurrence
              of invalidating outbreaks.1,24
            </p>
            <h1>Preventive strategies</h1>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              Specific preventive strategies at the community level such as (i)
              implementing effective communication and (ii) providing adequate
              psychological services should be carried out in order to attenuate
              the psychological and psychosocial impact of COVID-19 outbreak.
              Health education needs to be enhanced using online platforms,
              social fear related to COVID-19 needs to be correctly addressed
              while stigma and discrimination need to be recognized as major
              challenges able to reinforce the feelings of uncertainty in a
              period of social crisis. Hospitals protocols linked to the early
              and effective management of health emergency need to be
              implemented while healthcare professionals need to be supplied by
              adequate protective facilities.
            </p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
              Implementing community-based strategies to support resilience and
              psychologically vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 crisis
              is fundamental for any community.38 The psychological impact of
              fear and anxiety induced by the rapid spread of pandemic needs to
              be clearly recognized as a public health priority for both
              authorities and policy makers who should rapidly adopt clear
              behavioral strategies to reduce the burden of disease and the
              dramatic mental health consequences of this outbreak.
