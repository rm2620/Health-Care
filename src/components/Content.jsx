     Immunise rural India against Coronavirus

     <h4>
     The rapidly rising number of active cases and predictions of a peak by February indicate the third wave of COVID-19 has well and truly hit India. With daily case numbers increasing exponentially and the threat of further variants, the best option to try and end the pandemic is to vaccinate all eligible citizens. While in cities there is awareness and availability of vaccines, in our rural communities the reality is very different.

     <div className="content-2">
    <h4>Vaccination inequities still persist in India. There are multiple factors like lack of access, digital illiteracy, vaccine hesitancy due to misinformation and rumours etc, that have led to a slower and unequal rollout of vaccination in the countryside. People in wealthier, urban districts are better protected than their counterparts in economically insecure, rural districts. According to public health experts, the need for vaccination is more pressing in rural areas, where access to health facilities is poorer.

While we immunise ourselves, let us not forget our rural counterparts - because no one is safe till everyone is. Help immunise India against COVID-19. #TogetherWeCan.
